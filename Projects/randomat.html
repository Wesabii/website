							<h1>Randomat 2.0 - Solo Developer</h1>
							<p>An addon for Garry's Mod Trouble in Terrorist Town that triggers random game changing events that last for the rest of the round.</p>
							<p>I started this project in first year of university and the explosion in popularity is what made me absolutely certain that this is what I wanted to be doing for the rest of my life. It's an old project at this point and I would do it completely differently if I started it now, but I am still proud of it and I still think it has a lot of very well designed events.</p>
							
							<h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
							<p>I set myself some ground rules when making this addon. First of all no matter what event triggers I wanted to keep the core identity of the game as a social deduction game. That's what you sat down to play, so if a random event forces you to play something else that kinda sucks. </p>
							<p>Secondly I wanted to preserve the traitor roles as much as possible. Some people really enjoy playing traitor but can have a huge dry streak of always playing innocent, so if a random event removes your traitor round that sucks. Also events can trigger mid-round, so if you've made some awesome plays and you stop being a traitor then you just feel like you've wasted your time. </p>
							<p>Finally the goal is for events to be fun above everything else. Balance shouldn't matter too too much so long as both teams are having fun. No event should decide the game for either team outright. If something benefits one team more than another then it should at the very least be an interesting challenge for the disadvantaged team. Some events are designed to be terrifying, some are designed to be silly, and some are designed to be interesting. In all cases the main goal is to illicit strong reactions from the players.</p>

							<h2>Events</h2>
							<p>Listed below are a few of the events I especially enjoy and my thoughts on them:</p>

							<h3>You can only jump once</h3>
							<p>Players die the second time they jump</p>

							<p>This is one of my absolute favourites. Even if it doesn't catch you out it makes you realise how reliant on the space bar you have been. Announcing the death to the entire server when someone jumps twice will also always be funny, at the very least to everyone else. Having it be the second jump that kills you serves two purposes: first - if you find yourself in a hole when the event starts you can jump out, second - if you catch yourself jumping once, you get that moment of realisation and terror that is always funny.</p>

							<p>Alerts all players when any player with a buy menu buys something</p>

							<p>Massively disadvantages traitors, but also is inherently a tool the traitors can use for their advantage too. You buy a C4 and suddenly everyone is paranoid, you buy a body bomb and nobody wants to search any corpses anymore. If you play in a regular playgroup you can buy an item that most people associate with a different player to throw suspicion. This event plays very different in a regular group and a group of randoms, but both are interesting in their own ways.</p>
